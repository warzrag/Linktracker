# Demo User Issue Analysis & Resolution

## üîç Issue Identified

The user is seeing "Demo User" in their link previews because there is a user account in the database with the literal display name "Demo User". This is not a bug in the code - the `PublicLinkPreview` component is correctly displaying `link.user.name`, which contains "Demo User".

## üìä Current Database State

### Users in System:
1. **admin@linktracker.app** (@admin) - "Administrateur" - 2 links
2. **demo@getallmylinks.com** (@demo) - "Demo User" - 3 links ‚ö†Ô∏è **THIS IS THE ISSUE**

### Links Showing "Demo User":
- `/dzdzfezadfze` - "zdzdzdzd" (3 destinations)
- `/test-link` - "OF" (1 destination) 
- `/test` - "TEST" (1 destination)

## üéØ Root Cause

The user account `demo@getallmylinks.com` was created with `name: "Demo User"`. When links owned by this account are viewed publicly, they correctly display the user's name, which is "Demo User".

## üí° Solutions

### Option 1: Update User Name (Recommended for Real Users)
If this is a real user who just needs to update their profile:

```bash
# Update to real name
npx tsx scripts/quick-fix-demo-user.ts "John Smith"
```

### Option 2: Delete Demo Account (Recommended for Test Data)
If this is just test data that should be removed:

```bash
# Delete the demo user and all their links
npx tsx scripts/quick-fix-demo-user.ts DELETE
```

### Option 3: Manual Profile Update
The user can also update their profile through the app:
1. Login with `demo@getallmylinks.com`
2. Go to Settings/Profile
3. Update the "Name" field from "Demo User" to their real name

## üîß Technical Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- The User model has these relevant fields:
- name: String? (This contains "Demo User")
- username: String (This contains "demo") 
- email: String (This contains "demo@getallmylinks.com")
```

### Component Behavior
```tsx
// PublicLinkPreview.tsx correctly displays:
<h2>{link.user.name || link.user.username}</h2>
// Which shows "Demo User" because that's the actual user.name value
```

### Authentication Flow
- The auth system is working correctly
- No demo user enforcement in the code
- Issue is purely data-related, not code-related

## üö® Important Notes

1. **This is NOT a bug** - the system is working as designed
2. **Demo scripts exist** - Check `/scripts/` directory for demo user creation scripts
3. **Data integrity** - The links belong to the demo user account legitimately
4. **User identification** - Need to determine if this is a real user or test data

## üéâ Next Steps

1. **Determine user type**: Is `demo@getallmylinks.com` a real user or test data?
2. **Choose resolution**: Use Option 1 for real users, Option 2 for test data
3. **Execute fix**: Run the appropriate quick-fix command
4. **Verify resolution**: Check that links now show the correct user name
5. **Consider cleanup**: Remove demo creation scripts if no longer needed
